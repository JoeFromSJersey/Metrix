# Metrix Coin
Metrix is a peer to peer hybrid digital currency. It creates utility products that allow Metrix to be used in everyday scenarios. It also offers partnership opportunities to other cryptocurrencies to use the Metrix platform. As the Metrix wallet technology evolves, we strive to simplify the processes of staking or masternode ownership as well as improve your overall wallet experience

## Wallet Information
The new Metrix wallet Altitude can be downloaded from the [Altitude Repository](https://github.com/TheLindaProjectInc/Altitude/releases/latest).

If you need the Metrix daemon, download it from the current [Metrix Repository](https://github.com/TheLindaProjectInc/Metrix/releases/latest).

## Masternode
Metrix’s use of masternodes enables Metrix to have unique features that are not possible in other cryptocurrencies. The Metrix community will operate these masternodes to help keep the network flowing. Masternodes have huge value in supporting the Metrix network. They are part of what defines Metrix from all of the other cryptocurrencies. Making Metrix more efficient, and more prepared for the future.

*A masternode requires 2 million Metrix Coins.

## One Click Masternodes
Metrix’s new mobile wallet and mobile app offers a turnkey solution, changing the dynamic of which masternodes are implemented to the user.  It is now easier than ever for the Metrix community to get involved in operating a masternode. Currently, masternodes are extremely difficult to set up unless you’re technically experienced and leads to users potentially missing out. TurnKey options are masternodes that are already set up for the user. 

*This is for users who wish to have a more hands off approach to operating masternodes.

## Staking
Proof of Stake (PoS) is a type of consensus algorithm for public blockchains. It ensures all wallets have a consensus on all transactions. It also weighs the economic stake of each wallet, so the more MRX a wallet has, the more it will have a say in the public blockchain. Unlike Bitcoin, where the algorithm rewards participants who solve cryptographic puzzles (Proof of Work), Metrix uses the PoS system. One of the significant benefits of a PoS system is the energy efficiency. Instead of wasting huge amounts of energy to mine coins, Metrix is a more eco-friendly coin, which means it is more likely to be adopted in the future. Also, a PoS algorithm reduces the chance of centralization. Other coins are likely to be centralized as all their miners are controlled by a few people, but this is not possible with Metrix. Metrix allows all wallets to get involved in staking. By simply holding your coins in a wallet, Metrix will automatically stake your coins for you. Staking helps Metrix stabilize the blockchain and will help Metrix verify transactions.
